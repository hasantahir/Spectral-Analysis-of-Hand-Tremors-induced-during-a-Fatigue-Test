% Use = for single equations

% Use &= for split equations

% Use commath package to properly write differential operators and derivatives.

% Use \int\limits to nicely put integral limits

% For long equations, use align environment with \notag\\ as a linebreak.

% To hide section numbers, place an asterisk after the section, e.g., \section*{}

% Put comments % in between the lines in order to avoid forming a new paragraph.

% To enter special characters into Inkspace figures, use Ctrl+U and then enter       the unicode. e.g., for \times symbol, the unicode is U+0D7. So the key entry would be Ctrl+U U+0d7 and then press enter.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Tremor is a rapid back and forth movement of one or more parts of the human body which can be quantified in healthy individuals and considered a pathological symptom \cite{RN8}. It affects the hands, arms, head, face, voice, trunk, and legs. Tremor occurs on its own or be a symptom associated with disorders, medicines, alcohol, mercury poisoning, anxiety or panic. The tremors can be classified into two main categories: resting and action tremor. The resting tremor (\SIrange{3}{6}{\hertz}) occurs when the affected body part is completely supported against gravity (e.g., hands resting on the lap), while the action tremor is produced by voluntary muscle contraction. There are further sub-classifications of the action tremor, namely postural, kinetic, intention tremor, task-specific tremor and isometric \cite{RN7}. Postural tremor (\SIrange{4}{12}{\hertz}) occurs when the affected body part maintains position against gravity (e.g., extending arms in front of body). Isometric tremor results from muscle contraction against stationary objects (e.g., holding a heavy object in one hand). Kinetic tremor, which occurs with voluntary movement, is either simple kinetic tremor or intention tremor. Simple kinetic tremor (3-10 Hz) is associated with movement of extremities (e.g., pronation-supination or flexion-extension wrist movements). Intention tremor (<5Hz) occurs during visually guided movement toward a target (e.g., finger-to-nose or finger-to-finger testing), with significant amplitude fluctuation on approaching the target. Task-specific tremor (4-10 Hz) occurs with specific action (e.g., handwriting tremor) {Smaga, 2003 #7}. Tremor is most commonly classified by its appearance and cause or origin.  Some of the most common forms of tremor include: essential, dystonic, cerebellar, psychogenic, physiological, parkinsonian and orthostatic {Bhidayasiri, 2005 #16} {Deuschl, 2001 #18}.Tremor is usually examined using an accelerometer and/or with electromyography. In the accelerometer, the total force measured in postural finger tremor is proportional to the acceleration. Acceleration reveals the high-frequency components well because faster oscillations generate more power within higher frequencies {Duval, 2005 #21}.Physiological tremor(PT) is defined as an oscillatory, roughly sinusoidal involuntary movement of a body part {Duval, 2005 #21}. All normal persons exhibit physiologic tremor, a benign, high-frequency, low-amplitude postural tremor. It is invisible to the naked eye and can be amplified by doing some action as holding a piece of paper on the outstretched hand or pointing a laser at a screen. Enhanced physiologic tremor is a visible, high-frequency postural tremor that occurs in the absence of neurologic disease and is caused by medical conditions such as thyrotoxicosis, hypoglycemia, the use of certain drugs, or withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines. It is usually reversible once the cause is corrected {Smaga, 2003 #7}.According to Galinsky et al. {Galinsky, 1990 #4}, physiological tremor consists of arhythrnic movements occurring at frequencies predominantly in the range of 7-12 Hz. Physiological tremor occurs in specific body areas of a healthy person resulting from an interaction of mechanical and nervous factors. It is composed of oscillations which stem from two principal components: the mechanical-reflex component and the central-neurogenic component {Tomczak, 2014 #22} {Carignan, 2012 #23}. The mechanical-reflex component is the larger of the two oscillations and its frequency is governed by the inertial and elastic properties of the body {Elble, 2003 #26}. When examining index finger tremor, frequencies below 7 Hz are mainly associated with mechanical-reflex components {Carignan, 2010 #1}. The mechanical-reflex component is driven by the resonance properties of a segment and could be influenced by reflex activities. The stretch reflex response to mechanical oscillation can be increased by fatigue, anxiety, and some medications, producing a modulation of motor-unit activity {Carignan, 2010 #1}. The central-neurogenic component of physiological tremor is associated with modulation of motor-unit activity and comprises oscillations at frequencies between 8 and 12 Hz. Frequencies in this range are associated with oscillations generated within the central nervous system whereas frequencies within the 16â€“30 
Hz range are associated with the mechanical resonance of the finger {Carignan, 2010 #1} {Vernooij, 2015 #2} {Carignan, 2012 #23} {Elble, 2003 #26}. The fatigue is a factor influencing characteristics of physiological tremor. In healthy adults, significant increases in the amplitude of the 8â€“12 Hz neural component are reported following simple task manipulations such as: voluntarily stiffening the limb, changing whole body postural position, and following exercise-induced fatigue {Morrison, 2013 #5}.The exercise-induced fatigue results in explicit changes in the time and frequency characteristics of the tremor output. The greatest effect being increased peak amplitude of the generated, 8â€“12 Hz frequency component {Morrison, 2005 #6}.The onset of fatigue produces enhanced physiological tremor, characterized by regular or monorhythmic amplitude oscillations {Galinsky, 1990 #4} {Smaga, 2003 #7}.A temporary decrease in tremor amplitude just after the strong brief effort is followed by its gradual increase above a pre-fatigue level {Gajewski, 2006 #24} {Galinsky, 1990 #4}.The purpose of this investigation is to examine the effect of fatigue on physiological tremor. In order to assess its impact on tremor, resting, postural and loaded finger and wrist tremors were recorded in healthy young adults using a non-invasive, wearable, cost-effective, continuous proactive system. The frequency and the amplitude of the finger/wrist tremorwere measured by compact high-precision accelerometers with two configurations supporting wrist and finger-based.

\section{Type style and Fonts}
Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman or Times New Roman may be used. If neither is available on your system, please use the font closest in appearance to Times. Avoid using bit-mapped fonts if possible. True-Type 1 or Open Type fonts are preferred. Please embed symbol fonts, as well, for math, etc.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the

% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
